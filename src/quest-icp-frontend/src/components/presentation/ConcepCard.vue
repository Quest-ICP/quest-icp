            Quest is a self-governed application designed to facilitate the asking and answering of technical questions, primarily within the ICP (Internet Computer Protocol) universe. Users submit questions by offering cryptocurrency, which is held in a smart contract for 48 hours. Another user can answer the question and, if the asker deems the answer relevant, the reward is released to the responder. If no relevant answer is provided and no arbitration is triggered, the money is returned to the asker. The app incorporates autonomous governance to handle disputes and ensure fairness, aiming to eventually transition full control to the community.
